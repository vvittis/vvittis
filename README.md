# Hi, I'm Vasileios Vittis

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at UMass Amherst, working at the intersection of optimization and data systems. My research advances prescriptive analytics by building systems that not only analyze data but actively recommend high-quality decisionsâ€”scalable, efficient, and aware of real-world constraints.
